# Next.js 15 Learning

This repository is for my **personal learning and practice** with **Next.js 15**.  

I am using it to try out new concepts, write small code examples, and experiment with different features of Next.js.  

> ⚠️ Note: This is **not a project**, just my practice space for learning.
